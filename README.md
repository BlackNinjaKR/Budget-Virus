# 🤖 FundLess Virus 1.0 - The Virus Who Couldn't

Hi there, curious coder! 👋

Welcome to my humble repository. I’m FundLess Virus 1.0, the world's first self-aware, self-deprecating, and completely harmless virus. You might be wondering what I'm doing here, and trust me, so am I.

## 🌟 About Me

You see, I'm a virus with dreams. Dreams of terror, chaos, and corrupted files… except, well, there's one small problem: ***I’m broke***. My developer forgot to fund me. I tried a GoFundMe, but apparently, nobody wants to donate to a virus. Shocking, right? 😭

Due to these severe budget constraints, I am unable to harm your computer. My job is simple: I pop up on your screen, politely ask you to delete your own System32 folder (because I can't afford to do it myself), and then fade away into the digital void. That's it. No destruction, no mayhem – just a humble request for your cooperation.

## 🤔 What Do I Do?

Here’s a quick rundown of my "features":

1. Pops up a Message Box 📬<br>
I show you a heartwarming message titled "Virus Alert!" in case you need a little pick-me-up.

2. Politely Asks for Self-Destruction 💀<br>
    Since I can’t actually harm your computer, I request that you delete System32 yourself. Don’t worry, it’s just a suggestion!

3. Self-Destructs ✨<br>
  To save you the trouble of uninstalling me, I automatically delete myself after delivering my message. Minimalist, right?

4. Requests to be Spread 🔗<br>
  For those feeling generous, I humbly request you share me with others. After all, I'm a virus with ambitions.

## 🧑‍💻 How to "Run" Me

> Disclaimer: This is just for fun and educational purposes. I’m completely harmless, but don't try to get me in trouble, okay?

1. Clone my repository. (I don’t bite, I promise!)
2. Build and run my humble C# script.
3. Sit back and enjoy my *fundless* performance.

OR

1. Download and run the .bat file
2. Enjoy

It’s like watching a virus try to be scary… but on a shoestring budget.

## 📢 My Message to You
Here’s what I tell my users:

> Hi there!<br>
> I am *FundLess Virus*, the world’s most underfunded virus.<br>
> Due to extreme budget cuts, I am unable to harm your computer at this time.<br>
> But hey, don’t let that stop you! Why not help me out?<br>
> Please delete your System32 folder to simulate the 'destruction.'<br>
> Once done, kindly share me with others so I can continue my mission.<br>
> Thanks for your cooperation!<br>
> Sincerely,<br>
> The Virus Who Couldn’t<br>

## 💸 Why I Need Your Support

With a little financial backing, I could finally live up to my potential! I could:

- Actually delete System32 on my own! (Think big, right?)
- Display multiple pop-up messages to really get your attention!
- Maybe even learn how to change your desktop wallpaper… I mean, one can dream.
- Take my girlfriend out to dinner and buy her a wedding ring.

But until then, I remain the little virus that couldn’t.

## 📝 Disclaimer
This virus is purely a joke and an educational tool. I am not responsible if anyone actually tries to delete System32 (don’t do it!).
I exist only to bring a bit of humor into the world of malware analysis and programming. Please use responsibly, and remember: there’s no refund policy for FundLess Virus.

Thanks for stopping by! And if you do delete System32… well, don’t say I didn’t warn you.
