# 🤖 FundLess Virus 1.0 - The Virus Who Couldn't

Hi there, curious coder! 👋

Welcome to my humble repository. **I’m FundLess Virus 1.0**, the world’s first self-aware, self-deprecating, and tragically underfunded virus. Why am I here? Honestly, I’m still figuring that out myself. The existential crisis is real.

## 🌟 About Me

So, here’s the deal: I’m a virus with a serious case of FOMO (Fear of Malware Obsolescence). I dream of terrorizing computers, corrupting files, and getting that big, scary hacker rep. But alas, there’s a catch: I’m broke. My developer couldn’t even spare enough for some basic scare tactics. Turns out, crowdfunding for a virus isn’t exactly a lucrative endeavor. Who knew? 😭

### A Day in the Life
While other viruses are out there flexing with fancy ransomware attacks, I’m over here showing up on your screen like, “*Hey, would you mind just, like, deleting **System32** for me?*” I mean, if it’s not too much trouble. Not to brag, but I’ve perfected the art of politeness. 🤥

## 🤔 What Exactly Do I Do?

Here’s a quick rundown of my "features":

1. Pops-up Message Box 📬<br>
I show you a heartwarming message titled "Virus Alert!" in case you need a little pick-me-up.

2. Politely Requesting You Delete System32 💀<br>
    Since I can’t actually mess with your files, I gently ask if you’d do it for me. I even say please.

3. Self-Destructs ✨<br>
  For your convenience, I delete myself right after my heartwarming message. Less clutter, more zen. Who says a virus can’t be courteous?

4. Requests to be Spread 🔗<br>
  Hey, if you’re feeling charitable, maybe tell a friend about me? I’d love a little exposure. Viral ambitions and all.

## 🧑‍💻 How to "*Install*" Me

> ***Disclaimer**: I am literally as harmless as a bookmark on your desktop. But, like, an annoying one. So please don’t delete System32; that would be way more hardcore than I could ever dream to be.*

1. Clone my repository. (I don’t bite, I promise!)
2. Build and run my humble C# script.
3. Sit back and enjoy my *fundless* performance.

OR

1. Download and run the Budget-Virus.bat file on your Windows computer
2. Sit back, watch, and try not to yawn too hard.

It’s like watching a virus try to be scary… but on a shoestring budget.

## 📢 My Message to You
Here’s what I tell my "VICTIMS" 😼:

> Hi there!<br>
> I am *FundLess Virus*, the world’s most underfunded virus.<br>
> Due to extreme budget cuts, I am unable to harm your computer at this time.<br>
> But hey, don’t let that stop you! Why not help me out?<br>
> Please delete your System32 folder to simulate the 'destruction.'<br>
> Once done, kindly share me with others so I can continue my mission.<br>
> Thanks for your cooperation!<br>
> Sincerely,<br>
> The Virus Who Couldn’t<br>

## 💸 Why You Should Support Me

With a little financial backing, I could finally live up to my potential! I could:

- Actually delete System32 on my own! (Like a MACHO virus.)
- Learn how to spam multiple pop-up windows. That’s right, double the inconvenience.
- Maybe even change your desktop wallpaper? It’s ambitious, I know.
- Take my girlfriend, Malwareena, out to dinner and buy her a bouquet.

But until then, I remain the world’s first and only crowdsourced, cash-strapped, and completely ineffective virus. 😭😭😭

## 🔮 Future Aspirations

Look, I may be down, but I’m not out. With a bit of luck and, well, literally any funding at all, here’s what I’m hoping to achieve in future versions:

- **Level 2 Annoyance**: Right now, I’m as harmless as a typo, but maybe someday I’ll be able to display multiple pop-ups that almost make you feel like closing them.
- **Wallpaper Pranks**: Imagine this—I could change your wallpaper to inspirational quotes like, “*Believe in Yourself*” or “*The Real Virus Was the Friends We Made Along the Way*.”
- **Launch Delays**: You open an app, and nothing happens. It’s me, just slowing it down a tiny bit. Annoying? Yes. Harmful? Still nope.
- **Fake Threat Level**: Picture this: a pop-up that says, “*Your files are being encrypted*.” But guess what? They’re not. I’m just practicing for the big leagues.
